This read me file is to give a quick overview of the function included as .py files in this directory. The functions were created to process IMAP-Lo EMv1 and EMv2 testing. As of the creation of this file, only EMv1 data from princton has been proccessed with these functions. The functions included on the date of creation are:

1. get_data_from_csv() ; requires only a file path and creates array from RAW DE files.
2. clean_dat() ; Cleans data from array generated by #1 and can produce golden triples in 
        the same format as #1.
3. remove_delayline_effects() ; Removes delay line effects from array in format produced
        by #1
4. plot_1D_tof() ; Creats 1D histograms from data file. Data can be cleaned directly from 
        optional argument. Delay line automatically removed.
5. plot_2d_data() ; Creats 1D histograms from data file. Data can be cleaned directly from 
        optional arguments. Delay line automatically removed.
        
, and I will include other functions here as requested.
